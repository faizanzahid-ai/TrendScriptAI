            "  There's day two of the 13th edition of the FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup and a brilliant Group C clash to finish the day as Spain look to replicate their 2013 run to the final. They face previous fourth place finishers, Senegal.  And there's the opening goal and what a goal it is as well. A superb strike to put Senegal in the lead. 90 seconds just over on the clock.  Mbaye goes in distance. Great save from the captain, Arseny Ndiaye.  Goal kick sent forward long and that is exceptional. And Seneg ...\n",

            " You are an expert storyteller. Your task is to write a story titled 'Athletic Club vs. Man. United: Extended Highlights | UEL Semi-final Leg 1 | CBS Sports Golazo'. The story MUST blend ALL of the following themes: funny, horror. Create well-developed characters that bring these themes to life. Each character should reflect different aspects of these themes through their personalities, decisions, and interactions. Ensure the setting, mood, and plot are immersive and compelling, and vividly express the combined themes. Base the plot loosely on the following YouTube transcript but feel free to add fictional twists, conflicts, and resolutions to make it engaging:  They hope they will get to know the place pretty well over the coming weeks.  Quite the prospect, plenty of history between them.  From the brilliance of Bielsa's team to the Busby Babes.  Athletic rocked by the absence of Ian Sanset.  17 goals this season because of hamstring trouble.  So Alex Benninger moves to the number 10.  Very close to the side that started both legs of that wild ride.  Against Lyon in the quarter-finals.  But Diogo Dalot's injury.  Well, no doubt that this is a real pressure occasion for Athletic Club.  The prospect of hosting a European final and playing in it.  Bruno Fernandes with a neat contribution.  And Garnaccio may be in here.  He's through the challenge.  And takes the chance, but the flag up.  And United joy cut short.  It's a flick around the corner.  Good pressure from Manchester United.  Let's get another look along the line.  He goes very, very quickly.  He gets a little bit of luck.  Excellent finish.  Very, as many clubs are, influenced by the English game.  Aronson-Addy finding Benninger.  Will go himself.  And Onana had to be in the wide away club.  Straight away, the pressure's coming.  You can't get out of your feet.  Press is really quick.  And he takes it on, doesn't he?  But ultimately, Danny Vivian has to come in with real determination.  Aronson-Addy.  Berenguer's cross!  Oh, and over the top by Iñaki Williams.  Potential here.  Iñaki.  Iñaki.  Iñaki Williams.  Can he keep his head?  Chance for Berenguer!  And a heroic piece of defending in the end from Victor Lindelof.  Very quick.  You can see now the space.  Head up.  Just has a look.  Puts it across.  Desperate defending.  I can't believe he doesn't get better contact.  He's having a look at the hole.  Bruno Fernandes with the kick.  It's certainly not amongst his best, but United may yet make something of it.  Here's Maguire.  That's a useful looking cross, too!  And a chance for Casemiro!  And that is pure gold for Manchester United.  He doesn't give it up.  He's so determined.  I'm thinking, that's it.  It's closed.  Set it off.  Goes again.  And this is a great ball in, you know, key area.  Just look at Casemiro.  The experience.  He's waiting.  The flick is there.  And then you always fancied him early on that back post.  But it was all about this play.  That little bit of cheff.  And then maybe you underestimate what he does.  And the second touch there.  Allowed the space.  And there he is.  The timing.  The experience.  What he's been through in all these competitions.  He's there to help Manchester United.  And this may be their year.  Ugarte in really strongly but effectively here.  Hoyland.  A nacho slip.  And a few suggesting there was contact with a hand.  It did look like it might have been.  Dangerous ball!  By Masraoui.  With which Hoyland couldn't quite connect.  Here's Fernandes.  Dorgus cross.  Here we go.  It's all down to...  Well...  It's all down to...  So...  Is the contact from Danny Vivian consequential enough?  There you look there.  That little bit of a toll.  So...  The penalty after lengthy deliberation is given.  And Danny Vivian sent off.  For denial of a goal-scoring opportunity.  Well, that changes so much in this game.  Here comes another.  It's the goalkeeper.  Oh, coolness personified.  And how the tide has turned here.  He's the personification of being confident under pressure pressures presses press pressing pushing pushes pushed past passed finished completed correctly successfully without fault error.  How amazing this football club. ♪♫ (Singing)...oh yeahhh.... ohhhh Yeahh.....yeahooo.... YEAH!! YEAAAAAAY!!!!! This Football League Final Game 2 is underway..!
